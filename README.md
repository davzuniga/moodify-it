## About this Project

MoodiFy It is a quick, one day project that I wanted to put together with the intention of showing beginner developers that even a simple idea that already exists can be re-targeted (and marketed!) as a powerful solution for a specific segment in big industries. 

The main goal behind this project was not to showcase technical skills, but since this is GitHub, I will share the stack of tools that were used in this project:

```
React (with a Vite template, because of speed!)
Values.js library
React Toastify library
```

And that's it! You can learn more about [Values.Js here](https://github.com/noeldelgado/values.js/blob/master/README.md), and about [Toastify in here](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction).

There's really nothing about MoodiFy it that doesn't already exist online (and probably with tons of improvements over the IDEA), but the main key is to make users feel: a) understood, b) welcomed, and c) effective.

When targeted as a specific tool to help with a specific issue, your apps become effective. A vague tool that requires login and can do a thousand things is very impressive to develop (and to possibly showcase some skills), but the key to succeed in interviews and as an entrepreneur is to create things that can be used from day-zero. Then you build upon them. 


## How To Use MoodifyIt 

There is a color-selection input and also a field that takes a `HEX` value. Either one can be use to select a color.

Then, the Moodify It! button will turn into the color that the user selected. Click on it.

The screen will display a grid of 21 different variations of the color that the user chose. Put yourself in the mind of a designer and you can see the value of such a tool! The grid will indicate what is the color that the user originally picked, and show 10 lighter tones (with the lightest being plain white) and 10 darker tones (with the darkest being black). Click on each color to copy it to your Clipboard.

And that's it! You have successfully 'Moodified' a color to explore the infinite paths of your own creativity (see? wording is key to convince a user to try your tool).

## Main Takeaways From The Project

Like I mentioned before, the project showcases solid React development foundations with some amazing Library integration and best file organization practices. The project is heeavily based on the tutorial by John Smilga, which can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tutorial-and-projects-course). 

The main takeaway that I wanted to showcase with this project is the fact that, as an engineer, the choice of solution becomes clear (and simple) when the problem is clearly understood. Made with the user in mind.

## Future Upgrades

Since this is just a 'conceptual' project, I'm not sure how much time I will spend coming back to it, but I want to include better styling, and possibly explore the following features:

- A user-controlled range of options.
- A section with inspiration based on the colors that the user is displaying. 

And I don't think anything else would be needed. Honestly, keeping a tool as minimalist as possibly can take this fun page very far.
